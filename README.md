# Miscellaneous
Here goes some old and some new stuff:

SimpleNeuron.py 
This script is an old modified one from SoloLearn or some other online ressource if I remember correctly... The neuron can be trained to guess linear equations, the current version guess correctly after approx. 200 iterations. Eq.: (a+b)*2

MultiVarLinRegr.py
This script was found by googling python implementation of a linear regression... Credits/links are available in the script. Initial plan was to modify this one to a more simple implementation... Separate code will be uploaded with a simple linear regression.
